https://www.aclcf.org/news/water-bottles-for-all-primary-school-students/ | WATER BOTTLES FOR ALL PRIMARY SCHOOL STUDENTS In a meaningful donation to primary school students across the country, the Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation offered more than 600.000 reusable bottles for personal use, with the aim of educating and familiarizing children with the reuse of materials in everyday life and the reduction of the environmental footprint. At the same time, the use of an individual bottle by young students protects the health of children and enhances the measures taken by the country to deal with the pandemic. The students’ reusable metal bottle is made of materials that meet the European standards of health and safety and covers a significant need of the children, at school as well as in their extracurricular activities. Since its establishment, the Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation, being at the vanguard and with a constant focus on the protection of the marine environment, carries out actions and invests in projects that raise awareness and activate children and young people, recognizing their important role in the change of mindset and habits for the protection of the environment.
