Laskaridis Charitable Foundation and the Cooperation Network for the Marine Environment are organizing an Online Workshop on "The Environment in the Era of the Pandemic" on Wednesday, 9th December. The workshop aims to explore our perceptions of the value of the natural environment in crisis conditions, the impact of the pandemic on the design and activities of environmental organizations and bodies, the environmental education in the new reality and the prospects for the next day. The thematic discussions are attended by scientists from the entire environmental spectrum, representatives of environmental organizations and institutions, educators, as well as executives of public benefit institutions. The Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation, within the frameworks of strengthening and promoting cooperation in the protection of the seas, created in 2018 the “Cooperation Network for the Marine Environment”. The Network brings together 29 members from the research community, academic institutions, charitable foundations, NGOs and the business world. The main lines on which the Network’s action focuses are the exchange of good practices between the bodies, the enhancement of research on the marine environment condition and the possibilities for improvement thereof, the raising of awareness to the general population on issues of prevention and protection and the participation in policy making at local, national and European level.
