https://www.aclcf.org/sea/fishing-for-litter-2/ | FISHING FOR LITTER The "Fishing For Litter" project aims to reduce marine litter with the participation of the fishing community. Participating trawling fishermen are committed to record the litter caught up in their nets during their ordinary fishing activity, as well as for the disposal and management of waste in an environmentally friendly manner. The findings are written down by the fishermen in a special form and analyzed by the scientific team of the project, with the aim of understanding the nature of pollution at the bottom of the sea and searching for appropriate interventions to reduce it. The project is carried out in collaboration with the environmental organization iSea in the areas of Michaniona, Kavala and Alexandroupoli, where a significant percentage of the Greek fishing fleet is concentrated.
