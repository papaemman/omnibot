Laskaridis Charitable Foundation, as part of its participation in the 1821-2021 Initiative, held a two-day Conference entitled "Benevolence and New Hellenism", opening the discussion on the history of benevolence and the contribution thereof to the formation of Greece from the pre-revolutionary period until this day. Scientists and representatives of the charitable sector spoke about the branches affected by benevolence, the historical figures that promoted it, as well as the meaning of the term over the centuries and examined the challenges of Foundations today and the impact of their actions, the new trends in benevolence, the quality assessment criteria and, finally, the challenges of the future. The “1821-2021 Initiative” was established in 2018, in view of the 200-year anniversary of the Greek Revolution and is the result of the collaboration of 16 institutions of the country and the National Bank towards a common purpose. This collaboration was expressed by several actions throughout the country and abroad during the anniversary year of 2021 and continues with actions that complete the joint planning.
