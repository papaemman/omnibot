Laskaridis Charitable Foundation is included, for the second consecutive year, in the short list of nominees for the Innovation In Politics award. The Innovation in Politics Institute recognized Donousa’s effort to say “no” to single-use plastics as part of the SeaChange Greek Islands project, and to become the first Single-Use Plastics Free island. Thanks to the excellent cooperation of the Foundation with the three associations of the island, Donousa committed to reduce and gradually ban single-use plastics since April 2019. Today most companies on the island participate in the project, taking firm steps to reduce pollution, turn to reusable materials and convert to sustainable practices in tourism and catering.
