The Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation has been supporting since 2016 the educational program "I Care and Act", which was designed and implemented by the Non-Profit Foundation "Desmos" in collaboration with the Lambrakis Foundation. Its goal is to cultivate volunteerism in school, as a basic tool for the formation of active citizens. The successful program is implemented in schools of all levels, throughout Greece, starring students who propose, plan and implement actions that they collectively choose.
