The Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation participates in the "Initiative 1821-2021", which was established in view of the 200th anniversary of the Greek Revolution, with the participation of 14 foundations and the National Bank.



The aim of the joint program is to highlight the way in which the anniversary of the Revolution will be an occasion for national reflection and an inspiration for the future.
The Foundation financially supports the commemorative exhibitions of the “Historical and Ethnological Society of Greece” in 8 regional museums (Ethnological Museum of Thrace, Tellogleion Foundation of Art of the AUTh, Multiple Development Public Benefit Corporation of the Municipality of Veroia, Folklore Historical Museum of Larisa, The Messolonghi Byron Society, Naval and Historical Museum of Galaxidi, National Gallery- Alexandros Soutzos Museum – Nafplio Branch, Naval Museum of Crete).
It also supports the Chair of Modern Greek Literature of the Sapienza University of Rome in publishing monographs on the Greek Revolution, supporting a student competition in the senior high schools of Rome on 1821 and Italian Philhellenism, as well as establishing an award for scientific monograph on the Italian Philhellenic Movement and the Greek Revolution (Scientific Responsible: Professor Christos Bintoudis).
Finally, it prepares the organization of an international conference on “Benevolence and Modern Hellenism” in November 2021.
