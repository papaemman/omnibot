"Typhoon", the unique operational vessel of the Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation, travels year-round to the four corners of Greece, meticulously cleaning up the country’s inaccessible shores.



To date, the “Typhoon Project” team has cleaned over 1,453 shores in the Cyclades and North Aegean, the Saronic and Thermaic Gulfs, Crete, Sporades and the Peloponnese, removing over 168,188 kg of litter. At the same time, “Typhoon” serves as a research base for scientific teams studying marine pollution in Greece. For its contribution to marine protection, the “Typhoon Project” won the prestigious “Sustainability Award” at the Lloyd’s List Greek Shipping Virtual Awards 2020.
The “Typhoon Project” aims to clean the entire Greek coastline, giving back clean shores to the country’s inhabitants and visitors.
