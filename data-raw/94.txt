Aiming at studying and reflecting the impacts of Covid-19 pandemic on the marine environment and on the sea professions, the Cooperation Network for the Marine Environment and Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation prepared the collective publication "Pandemic, Sea and Man in Greece".



The collective work published by Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation will act as a “time capsule” of the impacts of the pandemic on the marine environment, to convey the first assessments emerging from the new facts brought about by the pandemic and to constitute a basis of reference and comparison with any perchance future pandemics. It includes eleven texts written by specialist scientists and researchers in the sector.
Important bodies, such as the University of Patras, the Athens University of Economics and Business, the University of the Aegean, the Hellenic Center for Marine Research (HCMR), the Ecological Recycling Society, HELMEPA, the Hellenic Society for the Protection of Nature (HSPN), the Lambrakis Foundation, iSea, the Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation, as well as the Oceanographer Francois Galgani and the marine ecologist and filmmaker Pierre-Yves Cousteau participated in the editorial board and in the writing of the volume.
