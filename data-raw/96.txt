The Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation and the Ministry of Culture and Sports signed a Memorandum of Cooperation, to develop actions in areas related to the protection of the natural and cultural environment, the cultivation of environmental awareness and the elaboration of awareness-raising training programs in the protection of the monumental reserve. 



The aim of the Memorandum of Cooperation is the joint participation in projects, initiatives and funded programs that will include organized clean-up actions in areas of special historical importance, educational programs and environmental awareness-raising activities, as well as the establishment of “green spots and zones” in appropriate archeological sites. Within this framework, the officials of the Ministry of Culture and Sports and the supervised bodies thereof will be informed and will get acquainted with good practices regarding the reduction of single-use plastics and, hence, their replacement with environmentally friendly materials.
The Memorandum of Cooperation was signed on behalf of the Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation by the Chairman Evi Lazou and on behalf of the Ministry of Culture and Sports by the Minister Lina Mendoni. The implementation of the Memorandum of Cooperation is expected to start promptly, through the carrying out of joint actions for the next three years.
