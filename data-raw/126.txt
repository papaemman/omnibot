Filopappou Hill was the starting point of the new "Dryas" project, a collaboration between the Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation and the Ministry of Culture and Sports, within the framework of the three-year Memorandum of Cooperation signed by the two bodies.



The “Dryas” project aims at the joint development of actions for the protection of the natural and cultural environment of Greece, the cultivation of environmental awareness, as well as the raising of awareness for the protection of the country’s monumental stock from litter.
As part of the launch of the program, a clean-up action was carried out at the archaeological site of Filopappou Hill. Executives from the Foundation and the Ministry of Culture and Sports, as well as a significant number of volunteers, participated in the clean-up. On behalf of the Ministry of Culture and Sports, the Minister of Culture and Sports Ms. Lina Mendoni, as well as the Deputy Head of the Ephorate of Antiquities of the City of Athens, Ms. Elena Kountouri, participated in the action.
