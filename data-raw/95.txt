The Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation collaborates with Adidas for the prevention and avoidance of the plastic pollution of the sea and a more sustainable future for the planet.



The Foundation participates in the “END PLASTIC WASTE” campaign and features in an inspiring documentary that highlights the problem of plastic pollution and focuses on the need to solve it. The first screening of the documentary took place in May, at the Goulandris Museum of Natural History.
