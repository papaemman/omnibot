In order for Greece to become one of the first EU countries which will gradually reduce single-use plastics, the Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation partners with the Ministry of Environment and Energy to reduce and gradually end single-use plastics. Within this framework, the Foundation coordinates awareness actions for the implementation of the European Directive 2019/904 on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment, offers advice and highlights good practices for a life without single-use plastics.
