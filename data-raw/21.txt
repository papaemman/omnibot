The Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation collaborates with the Ministry of National Defence on the joint participation in the national effort for the protection of the environment, the gradual abolition of single-use plastics and hence the prevention and avoidance of marine pollution. Within the framework of the three-year Memorandum of Cooperation, that was signed in September 2021, the Military Open Science of the Ministry of National Defence will utilize the know-how of the Foundation, which focuses on the protection of the marine environment and the fight against marine pollution, to collect data on the kinds, origin and volumes of waste found in the Greek seas. The Memorandum of Cooperation aims to familiarize members of the Armed Forces with the Environmental-Energy and Climate Change Adaptation Policy of the Ministry of National Defence.
