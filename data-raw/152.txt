Defending the collective interest in all sectors and contributing to the fight against opaque procedures is one of the main areas of interest of the Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation.




THALES
The Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation co-finances the Thales II project, which elaborates the study, mapping and evaluation of the NGO ecosystem in Greece. The objectives of the project are to improve the efficiency of the charitable sector, to promote the principles of transparency and sound administration, to enhance the image of non-profit organizations and the trust in them, as well as to highlight their role.


Vouliwatch
The Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation supported for a year the operation of the Vouliwatch organization, strengthening the monitoring of the parliamentary work on the thematic subjects of coastal protection, fishery and the blue economy. Within the framework of the cooperation, Vouliwatch forwarded to the Greek Parliament reports and questions of the Cooperation Network for the Marine Environment.
