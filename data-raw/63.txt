The Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation and the non-profit organization “The People's Trust” launch "TRUST THE CHANGE", a new program supporting small business on ten islands of the Cyclades.



Since 2018, “SeaChange Greek Islands” brings about positive environmental change on ten islands of the Cyclades. Coastal and underwater cleanups, environmental education programs and a variety of local activities raise awareness on the need for environmental protection. As of this year, the Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation takes an extra step, pairing two of its successful programs in order to support existing and newly established businesses that wish to make environmentally sustainable choices.
“TRUST THE CHANGE” shall provide financial assistance of up to 5.000 Euros to up to 20 businesses operating on the islands participating in the “SeaChange Greek Islands” program (Serifos, Sikinos, Amorgos, Folegandros, Kimolos, Anafi, Donousa, Schinousa, Irakleia and Koufonisia). Interested parties may submit a short business plan on the website http://www.thepeoplestrust.org/trust-the-change. Applications will be evaluated on the basis of the financial data and the environmental footprint of the proposed investment.
Applications are open from February 1st to 28th, 2021. The results will be announced at the end of March.
