The Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation, within the frameworks of strengthening and promoting cooperation in the protection of the seas, created in 2018 the "Cooperation Network for the Marine Environment". The Network brings together 29 members from the research community, academic institutions, charitable foundations, NGOs and the business world.



The main axes on which the Network’s action focuses are:

 Exchanging good practices between the bodies;
 Enhancing research on the marine environment condition and the possibilities for improvement thereof;
 Raising awareness to the general population on issues of prevention and protection;
 Participating in policy making at local, national and European level


The Network’s activities include the organization of workshops and information meetings, the promotion of proposals to opinion formers, the joint coastal cleanup, the production of TV spots having the form of social message on Single-Use Plastics, as well as information activities.
