The love for the environment and the raising of awareness for its protection start from a young age.



Children and young people who are familiar with the principles of environmental protection at school become responsible adults, with respect for the commonwealth and active participation in its preservation.
The educational programs of the Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation are addressed to children of Primary and Secondary education. Combining knowledge with experiential activities, they familiarize children with the significant problem of marine pollution and encourage them to responsibly manage marine litter, reduce single-use plastics and change habits, making themselves part of the solution in front of a pressing global problem.
