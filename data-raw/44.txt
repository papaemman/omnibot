NEWS


 


“SeaChange Greek Islands” successfully completed three years of activity on ten islands of the Cyclades, under the auspices of local municipalities and in collaboration with inhabitants, organizations and governing bodies. In 2021 it continues with an array of activities that support the local communities and contribution in changing our relationship with the marine environment.



Since 2018, “SeaChange Greek Islands” brings about positive environmental change in the Cyclades. Coastal and underwater cleanups, environmental education programs and a variety of local activities raise awareness on the need for environmental protection. Participating islands are Serifos, Sikinos, Amorgos, Folegandros, Kimolos, Anafi, Donousa, Schinousa, Irakleia and Koufonisia.
