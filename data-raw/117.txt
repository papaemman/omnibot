The Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation collaborates with the University of the Aegean within the frameworks of strengthening the research of plastic waste in the marine environment. The University research team launched in 2018 a series of pioneering experiments for the detection and quantification of plastic litter on the sea surface (PLP), using state-of-the-art technologies (European Satellite Sentinel-2, Planet satellites, drones).
